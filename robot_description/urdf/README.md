# Meshes
Used to draw the Robot when performing simulations.
Referenced by the Robot's URDF model.

These meshes were hand made from the [Hiwonder's LeArm 3d model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XROWMoxATQgtth6PfmkJGh0ac2aASvfC) (provided upon request).

## Software
For preparing these meshes, I used FreeCad (Draft and Mesh modes).
This product is new to me, so the models may not be perfect.
